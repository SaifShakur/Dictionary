This project replicates the "map" associative container in C++.
Elements stored in the container hold two values, a key value and item value.
The elements are sorted in a Binary Search Tree using the key values.

2 files make up the project:

-Dictionary.h: contains declaration of class "node" (the element stored in the 	
container) and class "Dictionary" (the container which sorts elements in a BST)

-Dictionary.cpp: contains definitions of class "node" and "Dictionary"

Extra:
-driver.cpp: used to test the the classes mentioned above
